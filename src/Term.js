Please refer to the identification verification through KYC/AML/CFT Process in Clause 7 for further information. Token swap service in the Website is a simple way to trade BEP-20/ERC-20 tokens for another across different blockchains. Swapping for users is intuitive; a user chooses an input, output token, and specifies an input amount, and the system will calculate how much of the output token user will receive. User will then execute the Swap with one click, receiving the output token issued on the blockchain as user wishes. The output token will be transferred and stored in the connected Wallet immediately after the click. For the Pool service, Liquidity Pools on the Website are permissionless with the integration of AMM system to help automated trade routing and the bot protection systems to help eliminate Liquidity Snipping as well as Front Running. Each Liquidity Pool in the Website is a trading venue for a pair of ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens. When the Pool is created, its balances of each token are zero, the first Liquidity Provider needs to set the initial price of the Pool. Users, as the Liquidity Providers, will be incentivized to deposit an equal value of both tokens into the existing Pool.</p>

                    <p>When Liquidity is deposited into the Pool, LP Tokens will be minted and sent to the user, as the Liquidity Provide, to the Wallet address. Whenever a trade occurs on the Pool, a fee is charged to the transaction sender. LP Tokens are themselves tradable assets, user may sell, transfer, or otherwise use such LP Tokens in any way the user sees fit. To retrieve the underlying Liquidity, plus any fees accursed, user, as the Liquidity Provider, must burn the LP Tokens, effectively exchanging such LP Tokens for the portion of the Liquidity Pool, plus any proportional fee allocations.</p>
